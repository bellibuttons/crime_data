This will be an ongoing process to create a single dataset for research related to crime. Thank you to Daniel Goldberg for assistance with this project. The single data is called "master_crime". The datasets currently included here are:

1. ucr_offenses_clearances - [UCR Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest 1960-2015](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/57)      
    
    This dataset contains:
    * Yearly counts for crimes committed (aggregated from monthly count)
    * Yearly counts for crimes cleared (aggregated from monthly count)
    * WARNING: The UCR does not differentiate between true zeroes (no crime committed) and missing value zeroes. All missing values are labeled as a 0. 
    
2. ucr_police_employee_leoka - [UCR Police Employee (LEOKA) 1975-2015](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/57)     
     
    This dataset contains:   
    * The number of male/female officers and civilian employees
    * Number of male/female officers per 1,000 population
    * Number of total officers per 1,000 population
    * Number of total civilian employees per 1,000 population

3. ucr_supplementary_homicide_report - [UCR Supplementary Homicide Reports 1975-2015](https://www.openicpsr.org/openicpsr/project/100699/version/V1/view)      
    
    This dataset contains:
    * Details on homicide victims, offenders, and circumstances
    * Age, race, and gender of homicide victims
    * Age, race, and gender of homicide offenders
    * Relationship between victim and offender
    * Circumstances of the homicide
