# crime_data
Crime data from the UCR and other sources. 

This will be an ongoing process to create a single dataset for research related to crime. The single data is called "master_crime". The datasets currently included here are:

1. ucr_offenses_clearances - UCR Offenses Known and Clearances by Arrest 1960-2015 (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/57)

2. ucr_police_employee_leoka - UCR Police Employee (LEOKA) 1975-2015 (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/57)

3. ucr_supplementary_homicide_report - UCR Supplementary Homicide Reports 1975-2014 (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/57)

4. police_agency_identifier_crosswalk - Law Enforcement Agency Identifiers Crosswalk Series (http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/NACJD/series/366)

5. master_column_dictionary - Explains which dataset each of the columns in master_crime is from. 


If you have any questions, find any bugs, or have any data to offer, my email is jacobkap@sas.upenn.edu.


For file types other than R (.rda), please use the Dropbox link to download the files. The cleaned files are in the "clean_files" folder. The raw data I used (from ICPSR) to create the datasets are also on Dropbox. https://www.dropbox.com/sh/9jy8ds057h7m00d/AACC082n_hahaKooNnxuJBs7a?dl=0
